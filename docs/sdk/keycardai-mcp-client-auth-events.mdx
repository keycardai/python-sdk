Protocol for receiving authentication completion notifications.

Classes implementing this protocol can subscribe to an AuthCoordinator
to receive notifications when completions are handled. This allows for
decoupled event handling, logging, analytics, UI updates, etc.


**Methods:**

#### `on_completion_handled` <sup><a href="https://github.com/keycardai/python-sdk/blob/main/src/keycardai/mcp/client/auth/events.py#L55" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
on_completion_handled(self, event: CompletionEvent) -> None
```

Called when an authentication completion has been handled.

This method is invoked by the AuthCoordinator after a completion
has been processed, whether successful or not. Implementations
should not raise exceptions, as they could interfere with the
completion flow.

**Args:**
- `event`: Completion event containing all relevant information

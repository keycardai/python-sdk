Authentication challenge details for a server requiring authentication.

This is returned when a server requires authentication that hasn't been completed yet.
The exact fields present depend on the authentication strategy configured for the server.

Strategy-specific fields may include (but are not limited to):
    - authorization_url: For browser-based auth flows
    - state: For CSRF protection in auth flows
    - Additional fields as defined by the authentication strategy


### `ToolInfo` <sup><a href="https://github.com/keycardai/python-sdk/blob/main/src/keycardai/mcp/client/types.py#L37" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


Information about a tool and which server provides it.

This type makes it explicit which server a tool belongs to,
useful when you need to track tool provenance across multiple servers.

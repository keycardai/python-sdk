# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the KeycardAI Python SDK project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project, along with their context and consequences. They help team members and future contributors understand why certain decisions were made.

## Format

We follow the standard ADR format:
- **Status**: Current state (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, etc.)
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision

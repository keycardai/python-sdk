# Setup Notes

## Development Status

This example is configured as a **complete, standalone package** demonstrating the proper structure and dependencies for using the KeyCard OAuth SDK.

### Current State
- ✅ **Package Structure**: Complete Python package with proper `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ **Dependency Management**: Configured for `uv` with lock file
- ✅ **Code Structure**: Clean separation of concerns and proper imports
- ✅ **Development Tools**: Configured with linting, formatting, and testing
- ⚠️ **Dependencies**: Some dependencies are commented out until packages are available

### Package Dependencies

#### Available Now
- `pydantic>=2.0.0` - Data validation and serialization
- `starlette>=0.27.0` - ASGI web framework components
- `httpx>=0.24.0` - HTTP client library
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` - Environment configuration management

#### Coming Soon (commented out in pyproject.toml)
- `keycardai-oauth>=1.0.0` - The unified OAuth client (Phase 1 implementation)
- `fastmcp>=1.0.0` - Model Context Protocol server framework

### How to Enable Full Functionality

Once the KeyCard OAuth SDK is published:

1. **Uncomment dependencies** in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   dependencies = [
       "keycardai-oauth>=1.0.0",  # Uncomment this line
       "fastmcp>=1.0.0",          # Uncomment this line
       # ... other dependencies
   ]
   ```

2. **Update the lock file**:
   ```bash
   uv lock
   ```

3. **Sync dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m delegated_token_exchange
   ```

### Current Demo Value

Even with dependencies commented out, this example provides:

- ✅ **Complete package structure** showing production-ready organization
- ✅ **Proper dependency management** with `pyproject.toml` and `uv`
- ✅ **Clean code architecture** demonstrating OAuth client usage patterns
- ✅ **Development workflow** with linting, formatting, and testing setup
- ✅ **Documentation** showing how to configure and deploy

This serves as a **reference implementation** for how developers should structure their projects when using the KeyCard OAuth SDK.
